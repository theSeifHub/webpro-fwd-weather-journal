# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project is to create an asynchronous web app that uses the Open Weather Web API with [express server](https://expressjs.com/) and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Udacity Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Running the server

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
2. Open your preferred CLI into the root folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.
5. Go to _http://localhost:8888/_ in your browser.
